# Models
## What is a model?
Models are just more classes that represent "things" you are manipulating in the app. Think of it like a workshop where you send some data to feed the workers and they spit out a perfectly polished ready to go product. When you need to work on things like the User ADUser's GAUser's anything that represents a collection of data, it is wise to use or create a model for it.
